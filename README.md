# [ZclassicDev.github.io](https://ZclassicDev.github.io)
We are the [Zclassic Community Development Team](https://github.com/ZclassicDev).

We are the organic continuation of the [vibrant Zclassic Community](https://twitter.com/ZclassicDev) that launched Bitcoin Private into being.


## Zclassic community's continuity plan
(this is originally partly based on this list: https://workflowy.com/s/IBvO.xDLlYhUKoy)<br/><br/>
01. as the first and foremost fork of Zcash and the most immaculate version of zk-SNARKs with just the Founders' Tax removed from its code, Zclassic has great historical, technological, and philosophical value in the world of cryptocurrency, if not in the world itself
02. alternate and continuing developers of Zclassic code have been testing an updated version at par with the core code of Zcash 1.0.14 full node client and experimenting with a user-friendly alternate ZCL wallet based on Electron wrapper as a front-end, both of which we encourage users and collaborators to try and test:
    - **Zclassic** Full Node version **1.0.14**: https://github.com/ZclassicDev/zclassic/releases
    - Electron ZCL Wallet *alpha*: https://github.com/zclassic-ce/zclassic - local changes pending<br/><br/> ![just a screenshot, watch this space!](https://github.com/ZclassicDev/ZclassicDev.github.io/raw/master/zclassic-ce.jpg "new Electron ZCL Wallet (Zclassic Community Edition), an alternative Full-Node GUI client")
03. we intend to skip merging code changes from Zcash 1.0.15 and go straight to integrating development for an initial version of 1.1.0 codenamed #OverWinter scheduled for May, and implement a network upgrade later in June or July after thorough discussion with the Zclassic community and in consultation with miners, mining pool operators, previous maintainers of Zclassic code and the Bitcoin Private Team
04. the foregoing proposed schedule may be subject to change accordingly after such discussion and consultation with the wider community
05. it is our intention to continue developing Zclassic independently, as well as to keep in pace with developments from Zcash, ZenCash and Bitcoin Private with relevant code back-ported after rigorous testing, fostering values enshrined in every successful free software project and open source development
06. we intend to continue the collaboration of the Zclassic community and its developers with the Bitcoin Private community, on the basis not only of common history and common code between them but also in parallel developments in the future
07. in this area lies a role yet still for Zclassic in future Bitcoin Private development:
    - any consensus-changing major network upgrade parallel or analogue to Zcash upgrades can be tested on Zclassic first before proper implementation in Bitcoin Private (should developers decide to adopt it), based on a well-founded premise that Zclassic remains the closest fork to Zcash, and we intend to maintain it that way; it is Zclassic's greatest strength and viability
    - we invite not only the Bitcoin Private Team but potentially other Zcash-forks as well to look at Zclassic development as a principled and stable staging ground for major upgrades parallel to Zcash itself
    - zk-STARKs are coming, and Zclassic is the North, successful preparation and testing on Zclassic will be beneficial to the entire ecosystem of the Z-fork family
08. aside from trying to get Zclassic listed on more centralized exchanges, we welcome the possibility of collaborating with decentralized exchanges like BarterDEX because on-boarding new users requires Zclassic to  become easier to acquire online on more platforms
    - BarterDEX is an especially attractive partner, not only because of its decentralized model but also because its core Komodo platform is a fellow Zcash-fork at its core, integration with a user-friendly interface on a secure and private platform would be very interesting, to say the least
    - if partnership and collaboration with BarterDEX developers is successful, it could pave the way to a possible listing of Bitcoin Private there, as well, this is good for the wider ecosystem because centralized exchanges are, well, centralized and closed off to public scrutiny, yet subject to state regulation, therefore: uncensorable, anonymous, decentralized exchanges using free software, open protocols and open source development is a major improvement
09. other frequently requested features or proposals from the community are:
    1. Master Nodes System
    2. Staking System
    3. additional incentive for miners/mining pools
    4. TOR/i2p integration/obfuscation
    5. setting up Zclassic Community Nodes to replace those marked for decommissioning
    6. more ElectrumX Servers for Electrum light-wallets
  - **these requests will be considered and discussed further as more details come from their proponents and will be assesed if viable**
10. an initial Board of Zclassic Volunteers will be setup from supporters, developers, miners, mining pool operators, other stakeholders, and at least one representative invited from the Bitcoin Private Team, preferably a previous maintainer of or contributor to Zclassic
11. a system of governance on how to maintain Zclassic code and network will be discussed by the initial Board of Zclassic Volunteers and an appropriate jurisdiction or territory will be discussed where such a future legal entity may be setup in the best interest of the Zclassic community
12. funding through donation of hashpower on fund.zclassic.org is feasible (for example, 30% of mining rewards?) an arrangement will be discussed with different mining pools on setting aside a portion of their pool fees to sponsor the maintenance and development of Zclassic code and its network, operators of cooperating mining pools may be invited to join the Board of Zclassic Volunteers or any successor organization it may decide to form afterwards
